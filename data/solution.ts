  overview:
    `To test the 'entry point' of the experience, I prototyped the image upload and processing states in code. This allowed me to evaluate
    the interaction cost of uploading a photo versus the potential value, before committing to building the complex analysis logic.`,
  keyInnovation:
    `I utilised an AI-integrated workflow (Figma → Cursor via MCP) to translate design nodes into working React code.
    This allowed me to verify the visual feedback loop (Upload → Loading State) in a live browser environment with zero manual coding time.`,
